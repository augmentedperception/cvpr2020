## Description
3D Capture and Rendering of humans has shown incredible progress in the last few years reaching a level of quality that is getting closer to Image Based Renderings (IBR) approaches. These systems usually rely on multiview capture setups and sophisticated pipelines to build a consistent, parameterized mesh of the performer with reflectance properties. The final goal of these approaches is to render high quality, photo-realistic humans that can match the quality of Hollywood productions, without any manual intervention or post-processing.

However, despite steady progress and encouraging results obtained by these 3D capture systems, they still face important challenges and limitations. For example, translucent and transparent objects cannot be easily captured; reconstructing thin structures (e.g. hair) is still very challenging even with high resolution depth sensors. At the same time, the computer vision community has focused its attention towards deep learning techniques to overcome the limitations of geometric approaches. 

In this tutorial, we will show how to combine geometric pipelines with recent advances in deep learning to construct disentangled 3D representations for photo-realistic renderings of humans in novel viewpoints and desired lighting conditions. We will walk the audience through the current state-of-the-art for 3D performance capture, highlighting the pros and cons of the various techniques.
